# Contribution Guidelines

* Use the following format: `| [library](link) | Description | [```MIT```][MIT]` |
* The link should be the name of the package or project
* Keep descriptions concise, clear and simple, without a period at the end
* If there is no license use the `[NO LICENSE]` tag
* If the license is unknown to you just link to it directly with the `[LICENSE]` tag (for example see another project)
* Add new licenses (such that no other project uses) to the bottom of the page for easy referencing
* New categories, or improvements to the existing ones are also welcome
* It is desirable for the whole thing to fit on one line after getting rendered by GitHub
* Use "SDL" in the list rather than "Simple Directmedia Layer

## Quality standard

To stay on the list, projects should follow these quality standards:

* Generally used and useful to the community
* Actively maintained,even if that just means take care of open issues
* Atleast partially documented

Thanks to all [contributors](https://github.com/robloach/awesome-sdl/graphs/contributors), you're awesome and this list wouldn't be possible without you!
